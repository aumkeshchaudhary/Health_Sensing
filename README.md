## 🧠 Models

### Architecture Comparison

| Model | Task | Avg Accuracy | Best Class Performance | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|------------------------|--------|
| **1D CNN** | Breathing Disorder | 94.7% | Normal: 94.8% recall | ✅ Baseline |
| **Conv-LSTM** | Breathing Disorder | 94.3% | Normal: 98.9% recall | ✅ Comparable |
| **1D CNN** | Sleep Stage | 44.5% | N2: 77.2% recall | ⚠️ Challenging |
| **Conv-LSTM** | Sleep Stage | 52.0% | N2: 54.5% recall | ⚠️ Improved |
| **Transformer** | Sleep Stage | 42.8% | N2: 72.5% recall | ⚠️ Needs tuning |

> 📊 **Note:** Sleep stage classification proves significantly more challenging than breathing disorder detection due to subtle inter-stage differences and class imbalance.

### Training Strategy
- **Cross-Validation:** Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) for generalization
- **Loss Function:** Weighted categorical cross-entropy (class imbalance)
- **Optimizer:** AdamW with cosine annealing
- **Regularization:** Dropout (0.3) + early stopping

---

## 📊 Results

### Task 1: Breathing Disorder Detection (LOSO Cross-Validation)

Both models achieve strong performance on detecting normal breathing patterns but struggle with disorder classes due to severe class imbalance.

## 🔍 Key Findings & Analysis

### ✅ Successes
- **High specificity** across all models (ability to correctly identify negative cases)
- **Conv-LSTM shows best overall performance** (52.0% avg accuracy) with temporal modeling
- **Normal breathing detection** achieves clinical-grade accuracy (>90%)
- **Strong cross-participant generalization** for dominant classes

### ⚠️ Critical Challenges

**1. Severe Class Imbalance**

```
Breathing Disorder Distribution:
├─ Normal:           ~90% of samples
├─ Hypopnea:         ~7%  of samples  
└─ Obstructive Apnea: ~3%  of samples

Sleep Stage Distribution:
├─ N2 (light sleep): ~45% of samples
├─ REM:              ~25% of samples
├─ Wake:             ~15% of samples
├─ N3 (deep sleep):  ~10% of samples
└─ N1 (transition):  ~5%  of samples
```

**2. Model Bias Toward Majority Classes**
- Models learn to predict dominant classes for high overall accuracy
- Minority classes (Hypopnea, Apnea, N1, N3) show near-zero recall
- High specificity but low sensitivity = poor clinical utility for disorders

**3. High Inter-Participant Variability**
- LOSO accuracy ranges: 24.9% - 77.4% (52.5 percentage point spread)
- Suggests participant-specific sleep patterns not well generalized
- Some participants may have unique physiological signatures

## 🔧 Recommended Improvements

### 1. Address Class Imbalance
- Implement SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling)
- Use focal loss or class-weighted cross-entropy
- Try ensemble methods with balanced sampling

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Add frequency-domain features (FFT, wavelet transforms)
- Calculate heart rate variability from SpO₂
- Include temporal context (previous/next window states)

### 3. Architecture Enhancements
- Multi-scale temporal convolutions (different receptive fields)
- Attention mechanisms to focus on discriminative patterns
- Multi-task learning (joint breathing + sleep stage prediction)

### 4. Data Augmentation
- Time warping, jittering, magnitude warping
- Mixup between similar classes
- Segment-level augmentation

### 5. Transfer Learning
- Pre-train on larger public sleep datasets (SHHS, MESA)
- Fine-tune on DeepMedico data
- Use domain adaptation techniques
